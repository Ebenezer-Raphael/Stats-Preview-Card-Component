## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Well, I learned how to add a filter to an image using CSS!

```css
img {
    filter: grayscale(100%) brightness(35%) sepia(100%) hue-rotate(-130deg) saturate(600%) contrast(0.69);
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to be able to make it possible to view the optimal layout depending on the device's screen size!

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites - Book by Jon Duckett](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - This helped me to address minor issues in my code and I will use it going forward.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) - This amazing forum helped me finally understand how to add filters to an image. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs help understanding certain concepts.
